# P6 Security Hardening - Sprint 3 Complete

## Overview
Security hardening implementation for Edgar's Auto Shop production environment following security best practices.

## Implemented Security Measures ✅

### ECR Security
- ✅ **Image Scanning**: Enabled `scanOnPush=true` for vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated cleanup of old images
  - Keep last 10 production images (tagged: prod, release)
  - Keep last 5 development images (tagged: dev, staging)
  - Delete untagged images after 1 day

### Lambda Security
- ✅ **IAM Authentication**: Function URL requires AWS IAM (completed in P5)
- ❌ **Concurrency Limits**: Skipped due to account limits (10 total concurrent executions)
- ✅ **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboard and alarms configured

### Cost & Monitoring
- ✅ **CloudWatch Dashboard**: "EdgarAutoShop-Production-Monitoring"
  - Lambda performance metrics (duration, invocations, errors, throttles)
  - Concurrency and latency tracking (p95, p99)
  - Cost monitoring by service (Lambda, EC2, RDS)
  - Resource utilization monitoring
  - Error log analysis
  - Daily summary metrics

- ✅ **CloudWatch Alarms**:
  - High error rate (>5 errors in 10 minutes)
  - High latency (>800ms average)

## Security Configuration Details

### ECR Repository Settings
```bash
# Repository: edgar-auto-shop-dev-flask-app
# Scan on push: Enabled
# Lifecycle rules:
#   - Production images: Keep 10
#   - Dev/staging images: Keep 5
#   - Untagged: Delete after 1 day
```

### Lambda Function Settings
```bash
# Function: edgar-auto-shop-dev-flask-app
# Auth: AWS_IAM (requires SigV4 signing)
# Concurrency: No limits (account constraint)
# Monitoring: Enhanced via CloudWatch
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **Error Rate Alert**: >5 errors in 10 minutes
- **Latency Alert**: >800ms average duration
- **Cost Tracking**: Daily estimated charges by service

## Access & Management

### CloudWatch Dashboard
```bash
# View monitoring dashboard:
aws cloudwatch get-dashboard --dashboard-name "EdgarAutoShop-Production-Monitoring"

# Access via Console:
# https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#dashboards:name=EdgarAutoShop-Production-Monitoring
```

### ECR Management
```bash
# Check scan results:
aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings --repository-name edgar-auto-shop-dev-flask-app

# Trigger manual scan:
aws ecr start-image-scan --repository-name edgar-auto-shop-dev-flask-app --image-id imageTag=latest
```

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review Scan Results**: Check ECR vulnerability scans regularly
2. **Monitor Costs**: Set up billing alerts for unexpected charges
3. **Update Dependencies**: Address any security vulnerabilities found

### Future Enhancements
1. **Concurrency Limits**: Increase account limits and set function-specific caps
2. **WAF Integration**: Add AWS WAF for additional protection
3. **Secrets Management**: Move sensitive config to AWS Secrets Manager
4. **Network Security**: Implement VPC endpoints for private connectivity

## Files Created
- `monitoring/cloudwatch-dashboard.json` - Dashboard configuration
- `monitoring/p6-security-hardening.md` - This documentation

## Compliance Notes
- ✅ Container image vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Access control via IAM
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Cost optimization policies
- ✅ Automated lifecycle management

## P6 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Security hardening measures implemented successfully. Production environment now has:
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Cost monitoring and alerting
- Performance monitoring with SLO tracking
- Proper access controls via IAM authentication

**Next**: Proceed to P7 CI/CD Gates implementation.
