## 🚨 What to Build Next (Priority Order)

### **Must-Have Security Additions (from Gemini's suggestions):**
1. **AWS Secrets Manager** for RDS passwords - This is non-negotiable
2. **Lambda Authorizer** for proper JWT validation - Not just basic auth
3. **Rate Limiting** on all endpoints - Prevent abuse and bill shock
4. **CloudWatch Alarms** - Know when things break

### **This Week's Core Features:**
1. **Booking API** - Without this, nothing else matters
2. **Database with migrations** - Use node-pg-migrate
3. **Proper error handling** - Loading states, user-friendly messages
4. **Basic Auth with security** - Bcrypt, rate limits, authorizer
5. **Mobile-responsive admin** - Edgar uses his phone

### **Sprint 2 Features (Weeks 3-4):**
- SMS notifications (email is fine for MVP)
- Customer accounts & vehicle management  
- Payment processing with Stripe
- Advanced scheduling features
- Service packages and bundles

### **Sprint 3+ (Nice to Have):**
- Analytics dashboards
- Route optimization
- Multi-mechanic support
- Automated marketing
- Enterprise security features

**Remember**: A secure, working system with basic features is better than a feature-rich system with security holes!

        └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            (Authentication Flow)
```

### **Implementation Priority Order**

**1. Complete Core API (2-3 days)**
```javascript
// Priority endpoints needed:
POST   /appointments     // Create booking
GET    /appointments     // List bookings
GET    /availability     // Check open slots
DELETE /appointments/:id // Cancel booking
```

**2. Add RDS for Relational Data (1 day)**
- Your init.sql is ready to use
- Need to provision RDS instance
- Update Lambda to use PostgreSQL

**3. Connect Frontend to Backend (1-2 days)**
- Update frontend API calls
- Add loading states
- Handle errors gracefully
- Test booking flow end-to-end

**4. Basic Authentication (2 days)**
- Cognito setup (start simple)
- Protect appointment endpoints
- Add login/signup pages
- Store user context

**5. Admin Features for Edgar (1-2 days)**
- Daily schedule view
- Simple dashboard
- Mark appointments complete
- Download data as CSV

### **Quick Wins to Consider**
1. **Email notifications first** - Easier than SMS, still valuable
2. **Basic auth without Cognito** - JWT with Lambda authorizer
3. **Static admin page** - Password-protected S3 page for Edgar
4. **CSV export** - Let Edgar download daily schedule

### **Architecture Decision Log**
```
Date: [Current]
Decision: Started with DynamoDB for quotes, need RDS for appointments
Rationale: Relational data (customers→appointments→services) needs PostgreSQL
Impact: Need to add RDS to infrastructure, update Lambda connections
```

- Case Study: Before/after of Edgar's business operations

---

## 1. Architecture Conflicts & Decisions

### **Current State**
- **Implemented**: Serverless architecture with Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB
- **Decision**: Continue with serverless, add RDS for relational data
- **Rationale**: Cost-effective for Edgar's scale, easier to maintain

### **Gemini's Security Suggestions to Implement NOW**
These aren't optional - they're the difference between a toy and a production system:

1. **AWS Secrets Manager** (Day 11)
   - Never put database passwords in code or Terraform
   - Costs ~$0.40/month per secret
   - Shows security maturity to employers

2. **Lambda Authorizer** (Day 13)
   - Don't just check for a token existing
   - Validate JWT properly at API Gateway level
   - Prevents unauthorized access to all endpoints

3. **Rate Limiting** (Day 13)
   - Prevent abuse of your API
   - Protect Edgar from unexpected AWS bills
   - Simple to add with API Gateway

4. **CloudWatch Alarms** (Day 15)
   - Know immediately when something breaks
   - Prevent silent failures
   - Critical for production systems

### **What Can Wait Until Sprint 2**
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) - overkill for MVP
- Automated secret rotation - nice but not critical
- SAST/DAST scanning - important but not blocking
- Multi-factor auth for admin - add after basic auth works
- Terratest - great practice but slows down MVP

**Remember**: Security basics are NOT optional, but enterprise-grade security can wait.

2. Leverage free tiers aggressively
3. Use Lambda for everything
4. Defer monitoring tools
5. Manual processes for admin

## 12. Interview Preparation & Container Knowledge 💼

### **The Architecture Decision Story**

**When they ask: "Tell me about a time you made an architecture decision"**

> "I evaluated both serverless and containerized architectures for a mobile mechanic platform. I created a decision matrix comparing:
> - Initial costs: $35/month (serverless) vs $150/month (containers)
> - Time to market: 2 weeks vs 4 weeks  
> - Operational overhead: near-zero vs significant
> - Scale points: Clear migration trigger at 10K appointments/month
>
> I chose serverless but designed the API to be container-ready, documenting the migration path. This saved the business $800/year while maintaining future flexibility."

### **Proving Container Knowledge Without Using Containers**

#### **Week 1 Additions (30 min each):**
```yaml
Day 2: 
  - Create docker-compose.yml for local PostgreSQL
  - Document why you're NOT using ECS (yet)
  
Day 4:
  - Write Dockerfile for the API (but deploy as Lambda)
  - Note: "Container-ready but serverless-deployed"
  
Day 6:
  - Add container build to CI/CD pipeline
  - Push to ECR (even though not deployed)
```

#### **Week 2 Additions:**
```yaml
Day 8:
  - Create ECS task definitions (uncommitted)
  - Document container migration triggers
  
Day 10:
  - Create architecture diagram showing container version
  - Write migration runbook
```

### **Three Documents That Prove You Understand Both:**

1. **Architecture Decision Record (ADR-001)**
   ```markdown
   # Serverless vs Container Decision
   
   ## Context
   Mobile mechanic with 10-20 daily appointments...
   
   ## Decision Matrix
   | Factor | Serverless | Containers | Winner |
   |--------|------------|------------|---------|
   | Monthly Cost | $35 | $150 | Serverless |
   | Time to Deploy | 1 week | 3 weeks | Serverless |
   | Scaling Effort | Automatic | Manual | Serverless |
   
   ## Migration Triggers
   - 10,000+ monthly appointments
   - Need for WebSocket connections
   - Complex ML model integration
   ```

2. **Migration Plan Document**
   - Step-by-step container migration
   - Cost projections at different scales
   - Zero-downtime migration strategy

3. **Blog Post**
   - "Why I Chose Serverless (And When I Wouldn't)"
   - Include real numbers from Edgar's business
   - Show both architectures with diagrams
