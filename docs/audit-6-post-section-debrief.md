---

## 1) Objectives & Scope — Reality Check

**Original objective:** Implement robust customer search functionality with optimized performance, proper indexing, and comprehensive profile management to support efficient appointment scheduling and customer service operations.

**In‑scope (actual)**

* [x] Customer search by name, phone, email with fuzzy matching
* [x] Database indexing optimization for search queries
* [x] Customer profile management and data integrity
* [x] Search performance benchmarking and optimization
* [x] Integration with appointment scheduling workflow
* [x] Customer data validation and normalization
* [x] Search analytics and usage tracking

**Out of scope / deferred**

* [ ] Advanced search filters (vehicle type, service history) - Phase 3
* [ ] Full-text search across service notes - Phase 3
* [ ] Customer segmentation and tagging system - Phase 3

**Non‑goals / explicitly rejected**

* [ ] Real-time customer data sync with external CRM (complexity exceeds current needs)
* [ ] Elasticsearch integration (PostgreSQL FTS sufficient for current scale)

---

## 2) What Shipped (by track)

**Data model & migrations**

* Changes: Added composite indexes on customers table for search optimization
* Migration IDs: `20250909_add_customer_search_indexes.sql`
* Indexes: `idx_customers_search_composite`, `idx_customers_phone_normalized`, `idx_customers_email_lower`

**APIs & contracts**

* Endpoints: `GET /api/customers/search?q={query}&limit={n}`, `GET /api/customers/:id/profile`, `PATCH /api/customers/:id`
* Sorting/paging/headers: Relevance-based sorting, limit-based pagination, ETag support for profile updates
* Error contract: `{error:{code,message,details?}}` with specific search error codes

**UI/UX**

* Surfaces changed: Customer search modal, appointment creation flow, customer profile pages
* A11y: ARIA live regions for search results, keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements

**Logic/Pricing (if applicable)**

* Rules/precedence implemented: Search relevance scoring (exact match > partial > fuzzy)
* Edge cases handled: Empty search, no results, duplicate customers, invalid phone formats

**Perf & caching**

* Client: Debounced search input, result memoization, virtual scrolling for large result sets
* Server: Composite indexes, query plan optimization, connection pooling benefits

**Security & guardrails**

* RBAC: Tenant-isolated search results via RLS
* Ownership validation: Customer access restricted by tenant_id
* Audit logs: Customer profile changes logged to audit_trail table

**Telemetry/observability**

* FE events: `app.customer_search`, `app.customer_profile_view`, `app.customer_select`
* BE logs: `api.search.query`, `api.search.results`, `api.customer.profile_access`

**Docs**

* README/API snippets updated: Customer search API documentation, integration examples
