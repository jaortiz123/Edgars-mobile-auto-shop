## 🔑 **OIDC Keyless Authentication: OPERATIONAL**

### **✅ Successful Integration**

**PR #71 has been successfully merged to main** with the complete OIDC implementation:

- ✅ **Keyless AWS Authentication**: No more static `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- ✅ **OIDC Provider**: GitHub identity provider operational in AWS IAM
- ✅ **IAM Role**: `GitHubActionsRole` with least-privilege permissions
- ✅ **Workflow Integration**: `unified-ci.yml` updated to use environment `AWS_ROLE_ARN`
- ✅ **Security Enhanced**: Short-lived tokens with 1-hour maximum duration
- ✅ **Branch Cleanup**: Feature branch `oidc-migration` deleted after successful merge

### **🧪 Smoke Test: PASSED**

**OIDC authentication validated successfully:**

```
✓ Configure AWS credentials via OIDC
✓ ✅ Who am I? (Should show role, no access keys)
✓ 🧪 Test basic AWS permissions
```

**Result**: GitHub Actions can now authenticate with AWS using OIDC tokens without any long-lived credentials stored in secrets.
