## Advanced Vehicle Actions Testing

### 🔄 Set Primary Vehicle Action
```typescript
// Vehicle Action: Set Primary
const setPrimaryBtn = firstVehicle.locator('button:has-text("Set Primary")');
if (await setPrimaryBtn.count() > 0) {
  await expect(setPrimaryBtn).toBeVisible();
  // Click would trigger: PATCH /api/admin/vehicles/:id { is_primary: true }
  // Expected Result: PRIMARY badge appears, other vehicles lose PRIMARY status
}
```

### ⏸️ Mark Inactive Vehicle Action
```typescript
// Vehicle Action: Mark Inactive/Reactivate
const inactiveBtn = firstVehicle.locator('button:has-text("Mark Inactive"), button:has-text("Reactivate")');
await expect(inactiveBtn.first()).toBeVisible();
// Click would trigger: PATCH /api/admin/vehicles/:id { is_active: false }
// Expected Result: INACTIVE badge appears, gray styling applied, button becomes "Reactivate"
```

### 🔄 Transfer Vehicle Action
```typescript
// Vehicle Action: Transfer
const transferBtn = firstVehicle.locator('button:has-text("Transfer...")');
await transferBtn.click();
await expect(page.locator('text=Transfer Vehicle')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.locator('text=Search for customer to transfer to:')).toBeVisible();
// Modal workflow: customer search → selection → confirmation
// API call: POST /api/admin/vehicles/:id/transfer { target_customer_id }
```
