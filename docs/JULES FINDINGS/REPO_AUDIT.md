# Repository Audit Report
Generated: 2025-08-07

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
- **Issue:** Critical security vulnerability in frontend dependencies.
  - **File Path:** `frontend/package.json`
  - **Why it's critical:** The `form-data` package has a critical vulnerability (`GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4`) that could be exploited. `npm audit` confirms this.
  - **Suggested fix:** Run `npm audit fix` in the `frontend` directory and validate that the application still functions correctly.

- **Issue:** Missing CSRF protection on API endpoints.
  - **File Path:** `backend/src/middleware/auth.js`, `backend/src/routes/*.js` (as per `AGENTS.md`)
  - **Why it's critical:** Without CSRF tokens, the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users. This is flagged as `SEC-004` in `AGENTS.md`.
  - **Suggested fix:** Implement CSRF token generation and validation middleware on all state-changing backend routes.

- **Issue:** Outdated authentication context file (`AuthContext.tsx`) still present and using `localStorage`.
  - **File Path:** `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - **Why it's critical:** The file uses an insecure method (`localStorage`) for handling tokens, which the project has apparently migrated away from (to HttpOnly cookies, as per `AGENTS.md`). Its presence creates a significant risk of being accidentally re-introduced and confusing developers.
  - **Suggested fix:** Delete the file `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` and ensure all parts of the application use the newer `AuthContextRobust.tsx`.

## ⚠️ High Priority (Fix Soon)
- **Issue:** Numerous outdated frontend dependencies with new major versions available.
  - **File Path:** `frontend/package.json`
  - **Impact if not fixed:** Missed security patches, performance improvements, and new features. Key examples include Vite (v6 -> v7), Tailwind CSS (v3 -> v4), and Zod (v3 -> v4).
  - **Recommended approach:** Systematically update packages one by one or in small groups, running regression tests after each update to ensure no breaking changes are introduced.

- **Issue:** Backend dependencies in `requirements.txt` are not pinned to specific versions.
  - **File Path:** `backend/requirements.txt`
  - **Impact if not fixed:** Builds are not reproducible. A `pip install` could pull different library versions on different machines or at different times, leading to "it works on my machine" bugs and potential breaking changes in production.
  - **Recommended approach:** Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate a file with pinned versions and commit it. Use a tool like `pip-tools` to manage dependencies going forward.

- **Issue:** Client-side exposure of environment variables.
  - **File Path:** Likely related to Vite configuration (`frontend/vite.config.ts`) and `.env` files.
  - **Impact if not fixed:** Sensitive information (API keys, etc.) could be bundled into the client-side JavaScript, making them publicly accessible. This is flagged as `BUILD-001` in `AGENTS.md`.
  - **Recommended approach:** Ensure only variables prefixed with `VITE_PUBLIC_` are used in the frontend code. Move all sensitive keys to the backend.

## 📝 Medium Priority (Technical Debt)
- **Issue:** Large, complex React components that violate the single-responsibility principle.
  - **Files affected:** `frontend/src/admin/Dashboard.tsx` (>500 lines), `frontend/src/components/admin/AppointmentDrawer.tsx`.
  - **Refactoring suggestions:** Break down these components into smaller, more focused ones. Extract business logic into custom hooks (e.g., `useDashboardData`, `useAppointmentActions`) to separate concerns and improve testability and readability.

- **Issue:** Outdated and contradictory documentation.
  - **Files affected:** `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - **Refactoring suggestions:** Update the `README.md` to reflect the current Flask/PostgreSQL architecture. Remove the incorrect references to DynamoDB and AWS Lambda as the primary components. Ensure the high-level overview is consistent with the detailed `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- **Issue:** `console.log` statements remaining in application source code.
  - **Files affected:** `frontend/src/admin/Dashboard.tsx`, `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`, and others.
  - **Refactoring suggestions:** Remove all debugging `console.log` statements from the application code. Implement a proper, structured logger (like Winston, which is already in the backend) that can be configured on a per-environment basis.

- **Issue:** Inconsistent file naming and orphaned/dead code.
  - **Files affected:** `AuthContext.tsx` vs `AuthContextRobust.tsx`, various files ending in `...fixed.tsx`, `...clean.ts`, etc.
  - **Refactoring suggestions:** Establish a clear policy to refactor or delete old files instead of creating new ones with suffixes. Delete the identified dead code (`AuthContext.tsx`, etc.) to reduce confusion and codebase size.

## 💭 Low Priority (Nice to Have)
- **Issue:** Cluttered root directory.
  - **Files affected:** Root of the repository.
  - **Enhancement suggestions:** Move the numerous `SPRINT_...`, `P1-T-...`, etc., markdown files into a dedicated `docs/reports` or `archive` directory to clean up the project root.

- **Issue:** Redundant backend dependencies.
  - **File Path:** `backend/requirements.txt`
  - **Enhancement suggestions:** The project lists both `psycopg2-binary` and `pg8000`. Only one PostgreSQL driver is needed. Choose one and remove the other to simplify the dependency tree.

- **Issue:** Hardcoded secrets in CI/test scripts.
  - **File Path:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `server_test_manager.sh`
  - **Code style improvements:** Replace hardcoded values like `JWT_SECRET=test-secret` with GitHub Actions secrets (`${{ secrets.JWT_TEST_SECRET }}`) for better security posture, even in test environments.

## ✅ Things Done Well
- **Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline:** The project has an exceptionally mature CI/CD setup in GitHub Actions, including parallel jobs, caching, automated security scans (`npm audit`, `safety`), and multiple forms of testing.
- **Robust Testing Strategy:** The inclusion of unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and accessibility tests demonstrates a strong commitment to quality. The flaky test detection (`P2-T-009`) is a particularly advanced and commendable practice.
- **Modern Frontend Stack:** The use of React 19 with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS is a modern and effective stack.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Managing infrastructure with Terraform (`infrastructure/`) is a best practice that ensures consistency and reproducibility.
- **Detailed Architecture Documentation:** The `ARCHITECTURE.md` file is thorough and well-written, providing a clear blueprint of the system.
- **Use of Secrets Manager:** The backend correctly uses AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials instead of hardcoding them.

## 📊 Quick Stats
- **Total files analyzed:** >500 (estimate based on file list)
- **Lines of code:** >20,000 (estimate based on file sizes and complexity)
- **Test coverage estimate:** Stated goal is 80%, but `AGENTS.md` and CI config suggest actual coverage is lower (CI enforces 60-75%).
- **Outdated dependencies:** >20 frontend packages are outdated, with several major versions behind. Backend dependencies are unpinned.
- **Security warnings:** 2 vulnerabilities found in the frontend (1 critical).

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan
1.  **Address Critical Vulnerabilities:** Immediately run `npm audit fix` on the frontend and implement CSRF protection on the backend. These are the highest-risk items.
2.  **Clean Up Codebase:** Delete the old `AuthContext.tsx` file and other orphaned/dead code to prevent security risks and developer confusion.
3.  **Stabilize Dependencies:** Pin all backend dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Plan a systematic upgrade of the outdated frontend packages.
4.  **Improve Documentation:** Update the `README.md` to match the current architecture.
5.  **Refactor Large Components:** Begin breaking down `Dashboard.tsx` and `AppointmentDrawer.tsx` into smaller, more manageable pieces to pay down technical debt.
6.  **Sanitize CI/CD:** Remove hardcoded secrets from the CI workflows and replace them with GitHub Actions secrets.
7.  **Remove `console.log` statements:** Replace debug logs with a proper logging framework.
