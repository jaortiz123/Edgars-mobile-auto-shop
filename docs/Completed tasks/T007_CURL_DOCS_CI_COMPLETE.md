# T-007 Implementation Complete: Curl Sample in Docs + CI Smoke Test

**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Task:** Add living example to prove envelope shape

## Summary

Successfully implemented T-007 requirements:

1. ‚úÖ **Added curl sample to appointments section in docs/API.md**
2. ‚úÖ **Created CI "docs-curl" job that tests API endpoint**
3. ‚úÖ **Made job optional to skip on PRs that don't touch backend**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Documentation Enhancement

**File Modified:** `docs/API.md`

Added curl sample to the appointments section after the `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` endpoint:

```bash
# Get admin appointments with envelope shape demonstration
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/appointments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  | jq '.errors'
```

This provides a living example that developers can use to test the API and verify the envelope structure.

### 2. CI Job Implementation

**File Modified:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Added new `docs-curl` job with the following features:

**Job Configuration:**
- Runs after `backend-tests` job
- Uses conditional execution: `if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' || contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files.*.filename, 'backend/') || contains(github.event.pull_request.changed_files.*.filename, 'docs/') }}`
- Skips on PRs that don't touch backend or docs files

**Job Steps:**
1. **Setup:** Install Python dependencies and jq for JSON processing
2. **Start Server:** Launch Flask server in background with memory fallback mode
3. **Health Check:** Wait up to 60 seconds for server to be ready
4. **API Test:** Make curl request to `/api/admin/appointments` endpoint
5. **Envelope Validation:** Use jq to assert `.errors == null` (T-007 requirement)
6. **Structure Validation:** Verify proper envelope structure with `data` and `meta` fields
7. **Cleanup:** Stop Flask server process

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
FALLBACK_TO_MEMORY: "true"
JWT_SECRET: test-secret
LOG_LEVEL: WARNING
```

### 3. Envelope Structure Verification

The CI job validates the standard API envelope format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "appointments": [...],
    "nextCursor": null
  },
  "errors": null,  // ‚Üê This is what we assert == null
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "uuid"
  }
}
```

**Key Assertions:**
- `.errors == null` (primary T-007 requirement)
- `data` field exists and is not null
- `meta` field exists and is not null
- `appointments` array exists within data

## Technical Implementation

### Server Configuration
- **Default Port:** 3001 (configured via `FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variable)
- **Memory Mode:** Uses `FALLBACK_TO_MEMORY=true` for CI environment
- **Health Endpoint:** `/health` for server readiness checks

### Error Handling
- **Timeout Protection:** 30-second limit for server startup
- **Graceful Failure:** CI job fails with clear error messages if:
  - Server doesn't start within timeout
  - API request fails (non-200 status)
  - Envelope structure is invalid
  - `.errors` field is not null

### Conditional Execution
The job intelligently skips on PRs that don't affect backend or documentation:
- ‚úÖ Runs on all `push` events to main/develop branches
- ‚úÖ Runs on PRs that modify `backend/` files
- ‚úÖ Runs on PRs that modify `docs/` files  
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skips on PRs that only modify frontend, infrastructure, etc.

## Validation Results

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests:** `test_get_admin_appointments()` confirms envelope structure
- ‚úÖ **Integration Tests:** `test_get_admin_appointments_returns_empty_list_if_no_db()` validates memory fallback
- ‚úÖ **CI Simulation:** Manual testing confirms curl approach works

### Expected CI Behavior
```bash
üåê Starting Flask server for curl test...
‚úÖ Server is ready!
üß™ Testing /api/admin/appointments endpoint...
üì° Making curl request to http://localhost:3001/api/admin/appointments
üìÑ Response: {"data":{"appointments":[],"nextCursor":null},"errors":null,"meta":{"request_id":"..."}}
‚úÖ SUCCESS: .errors field is null as expected
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Envelope structure is valid (has data and meta fields)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`docs/API.md`**
   - Added curl sample after appointments DELETE endpoint
   - Demonstrates envelope shape with `.errors` field assertion

2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
   - Added `docs-curl` job with full Flask server testing
   - Implemented conditional execution logic
   - Added jq-based JSON validation

## Integration with Existing CI

The new job fits seamlessly into the existing CI pipeline:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-lint
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-lint  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-tests ‚Üê docs-curl depends on this
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs-curl ‚Üê NEW: Validates API envelope shape
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ no-db-smoke-tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other jobs)
```

## Benefits

1. **Living Documentation:** The curl sample in docs provides an immediately usable example
2. **Continuous Validation:** CI ensures the envelope shape contract is never broken
3. **Developer Experience:** Developers can copy-paste the curl command for testing
4. **Performance Conscious:** Job only runs when relevant files change
5. **Robust Testing:** Validates both API functionality and response structure

## Notes

- The curl sample uses port 3001 (Flask default) for local development
- The CI job includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- The implementation leverages existing test infrastructure (`FALLBACK_TO_MEMORY`)
- The envelope validation follows the established pattern from existing tests

**T-007 Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

The curl sample provides a living example of the envelope shape, and the CI job ensures this contract is continuously validated with each relevant code change.
