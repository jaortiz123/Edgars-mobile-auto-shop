# Sprint 7 Task 1 (T1): Fix File Extensions - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully identified and renamed all `.ts` files containing JSX syntax to `.tsx` extensions to resolve TypeScript compilation errors.

## Files Renamed
1. **`src/tests/sprint3c-reminders.test.ts`** → **`src/tests/sprint3c-reminders.test.tsx`**
   - Contains extensive JSX including `<AppointmentReminderErrorBoundary>`, `<button>`, `<div>`, etc.
   - Test file with React component rendering using Testing Library

2. **`src/services/offlineSupport.ts`** → **`src/services/offlineSupport.tsx`**
   - Contains `OfflineStatusIndicator` React component with JSX rendering
   - Includes React hooks (`React.useState`, `React.useEffect`)
   - Returns JSX elements with className styling

3. **`src/services/performanceMonitoring.ts`** → **`src/services/performanceMonitoring.tsx`**
   - Contains `PerformanceWidget` React component with JSX rendering  
   - Includes React hooks (`React.useState`, `React.useEffect`, `React.useCallback`)
   - Returns complex JSX with conditional rendering and event handlers

## Verification Steps Completed

### ✅ File Renaming
- All three identified files successfully renamed using `mv` command
- No file system errors or conflicts

### ✅ Import Resolution
- Searched for any imports referencing old `.ts` extensions
- **No import statements found** that need updating
- TypeScript module resolution working correctly with new extensions

### ✅ TypeScript Compilation
- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no extension-related errors
- **No "Cannot find module" errors** for the renamed files
- Compilation errors present are related to Sprint 7 Tasks 2-6 (expected)

### ✅ Residual Pattern Search
- Searched for any remaining `.ts` file extensions in import statements
- Searched for remaining `.ts` files containing JSX syntax
- **No additional files found** requiring renaming

## Current Status
- **T1 Extension Fixes: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Files correctly recognized by TypeScript with `.tsx` extensions
- No extension-related compilation errors
- Ready for Sprint 7 Task 2 (Separate UI Service Logic)

## Next Steps
The remaining TypeScript errors are expected and will be addressed in subsequent Sprint 7 tasks:

- **T2**: Separate JSX from service files (offlineSupport.tsx, performanceMonitoring.tsx)
- **T3**: Update Vitest configuration for proper test environment
- **T4**: Create comprehensive test mocks
- **T5**: Refactor test files for better component isolation
- **T6**: Integrate coverage enforcement in CI pipeline

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminated all TypeScript extension-related compilation errors
- ✅ Proper JSX support in TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Foundation established for enterprise-grade testing architecture
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
