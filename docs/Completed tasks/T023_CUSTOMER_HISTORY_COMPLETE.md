## 📋 Implementation Details

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/customers/:id/history
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Roles: Owner, Advisor
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "data": {
    "pastAppointments": [
      {
        "id": "apt-123",
        "status": "COMPLETED",
        "start": "2025-07-15T10:00:00.000Z",
        "total_amount": 250.00,
        "paid_amount": 250.00,
        "created_at": "2025-07-10T09:00:00.000Z",
        "payments": [
          {
            "id": "pay-1",
            "amount": 250.00,
            "method": "cash",
            "created_at": "2025-07-15T10:30:00.000Z"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "payments": []
  },
  "errors": null,
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "..."
  }
}
```

### Database Query
- Uses LEFT JOIN to include appointments with/without payments
- Filters for completed appointment statuses only
- Orders by start date descending, then by appointment ID
- Groups payments as JSON array per appointment

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend (`/backend/local_server.py`)
- Role-based authentication check (Owner & Advisor only)
- Customer existence validation
- Complex SQL query with JSON aggregation for payments
- Proper datetime formatting with ISO strings
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Frontend (`/frontend/src/components/CustomerHistory.tsx`)
- React component with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- API integration with proper error handling
- Loading states with skeleton UI
- Responsive design with proper styling
- Payment formatting and display logic

### Testing Strategy
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library (8 comprehensive tests)
- Backend: Production validation with direct endpoint testing
- Integration: End-to-end verification between components
