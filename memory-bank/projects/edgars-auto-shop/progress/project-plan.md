# Edgar's Auto Shop - Project Plan & Status

## Executive Summary
Project Goal: To create a mobile-first, on-site auto repair platform for Edgar, streamlining appointment booking and improving customer experience.
Current Status: Core MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for appointment booking is fully operational and deployed on AWS. This includes a robust serverless backend and a fully integrated frontend.
Key Achievement: Successfully navigated and resolved complex infrastructure, networking, and data integration challenges to deliver a robust serverless solution.

## Project Overview & Business Value
Problem Statement (Edgar's Challenge): Manual booking (2-3 hours/day), high no-show rates (15-20%), frequent double-bookings, and no online presence.
Solution: A scalable, mobile-responsive web platform for 24/7 self-service appointment scheduling.
Projected Business Impact (Full Implementation): Reduce admin time by 80%, eliminate double-bookings, reduce no-shows via automated reminders, and expand market reach.
Key Features (Current MVP): Customer-facing web application with service selection, multi-step booking form, API for creating appointments, backend logic, and a confirmation page.

## Architecture Strategy: Serverless-First with Container Readiness
Core Architecture Decision: Serverless-first (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, RDS PostgreSQL) for cost optimization (estimated <$50/month), rapid deployment, and inherent scaling.
Detailed Components (Deployed MVP): Frontend (React), API Gateway (HTTP API), Lambda (Python 3.9, deployed as container image via ECR), RDS PostgreSQL (db.t3.micro), Secrets Manager (for DB credentials), Custom VPC & Security Groups.
Containerization Strategy (Future Path): Demonstrated via Dockerfile for Lambda, docker-compose.yml for local dev. Plan for migration to ECS/Fargate for higher scale (e.g., 10,000+ appointments/month, WebSockets).
