# Production-Ready Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation

## Security & Infrastructure Improvements

Based on your excellent feedback, implementing:
- ✅ RLS (Row-Level Security) for tenant isolation
- ✅ SSM Session Manager instead of SSH bastion
- ✅ Direct VPC app→RDS connection with RDS Proxy
- ✅ AWS Secrets Manager with rotation
- ✅ Terraform infrastructure as code
- ✅ Proper tenant constraints and indexes

## Phase 1: Secure RLS Tenant Model

### Immediate Implementation (This Sprint)
1. **RLS-based tenant isolation** - fastest to ship, strong security
2. **Tenant-aware constraints** - prevent cross-tenant data leaks
3. **Connection pooling prep** - RDS Proxy ready
4. **Secrets management** - rotate away from static passwords

### Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] Apply RLS migration with tenant constraints
- [ ] Update backend to set tenant context per request
- [ ] Test tenant isolation (automated cross-tenant access tests)
- [ ] Move to Secrets Manager
- [ ] Replace bastion with SSM Session Manager

## Implementation Ready

All components are coded and ready to deploy:
- `terraform/` - Complete IaC setup
- `backend/migrations/` - RLS tenant model with proper constraints
- `backend/tenant_middleware.py` - Request-level tenant context
- `tests/` - Cross-tenant isolation validation
- `setup-ssm-access.sh` - SSM Session Manager setup

Ready to proceed with RLS implementation?
