- **Disaster Recovery**: No backup/recovery procedures documented

## Infrastructure Architecture Analysis

### Current Deployment Model: Hybrid ECS + Lambda

**Components Discovered**:
- **Frontend**: React SPA ‚Üí ECS Fargate containers
- **Backend API**: Flask application ‚Üí ECS Fargate
- **Microservices**: Auth/Profile/Notification ‚Üí AWS Lambda functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with TLS 1.3/1.2

**Traffic Flow**:
```
Internet ‚Üí ALB (HTTPS) ‚Üí ECS Fargate Containers
                      ‚Üí Lambda Functions ‚Üí PostgreSQL
```

### Health Check Implementation

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ Container-level health checks in all Dockerfiles
- ‚úÖ ALB target group health checks (`/health` endpoint)
- ‚úÖ Lambda function monitoring via CloudWatch
- ‚ùå Missing application-level health endpoints
- ‚ùå No startup probes for Lambda cold starts

**Health Check Configuration**:
```terraform
health_check {
  enabled             = true
  interval            = 30
  path                = "/health"
  healthy_threshold   = 2
  unhealthy_threshold = 5
  timeout             = 5
  matcher             = "200-399"
}
```

### Deployment Strategy Assessment

**Current ECS Configuration**:
```terraform
deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 50
deployment_maximum_percent         = 200
desired_count                     = var.desired_count
```

**Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Rolling deployment prevents service interruption
- ‚úÖ 50% minimum ensures availability during updates
- ‚ùå No immediate rollback capability
- ‚ùå No deployment validation gates
- ‚ùå No database migration coordination

## Security & Policy Assessment

### Network Security
**Implemented**:
- Security groups for ALB and ECS services
- HTTPS termination with modern TLS policies
- Container isolation via AWS Fargate

**Missing**:
- Network segmentation policies
- Service-to-service encryption
- Identity-based access control

### Resource Management
**ECS Task Limits**:
- CPU: 256 (0.25 vCPU)
- Memory: 512 MB

**Lambda Functions**: Require verification of resource configurations

### High Availability
**Current**:
- Multi-AZ deployment via default public subnets
- ALB automatic failover
- ECS service with minimum healthy instances

**Missing**:
- Auto scaling based on metrics
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Disaster recovery procedures

**Assessment Conclusion**: Edgar's Mobile Auto Shop has a solid infrastructure foundation with excellent container security, but requires operational enhancements for production-grade reliability. The hybrid ECS + Lambda architecture is well-designed, with critical gaps in deployment strategy and operational procedures that must be addressed before production deployment.

**Overall Recommendation**: Proceed with immediate health endpoint implementation and Blue/Green deployment configuration to achieve production readiness within 2-3 weeks.
