# 🔑 OIDC Migration Complete - Keyless AWS Deployment Ready!

## ✅ What's Changed

Your GitHub Actions workflow is now ready for **keyless AWS authentication** using OIDC instead of long-lived access keys.

### **Updated Files**
- `.github/workflows/unified-ci.yml`: Updated to use `AWS_ROLE_ARN` (matching your environment secret)
- `.github/workflows/oidc-smoke-test.yml`: Added quick OIDC validation workflow

### **Key Benefits**
- 🚫 **No more AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** needed
- 🔒 **Enhanced security** with short-lived tokens
- 🎯 **Role-based access** with fine-grained permissions
- 📊 **Better audit trail** through AWS CloudTrail

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **1. Test OIDC Authentication**
After merging this PR, run the smoke test:

```bash
gh workflow run oidc-smoke-test.yml
```

**Expected output**:
- ✅ `aws sts get-caller-identity` shows role ARN (not user)
- ✅ No "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" mentioned anywhere
- ✅ Basic AWS service calls succeed

### **2. Test Real Deployment**
Push a commit to `main` and verify:
- ✅ "Configure AWS credentials" step succeeds
- ✅ ECR login/push works normally
- ✅ ECS deployment proceeds as before
- ✅ Health checks pass

## 🧹 Optional Cleanup (Recommended)

Once OIDC is working, you can safely remove these old secrets:

### **Repository Secrets to Remove**
```bash
# These are no longer needed with OIDC
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### **Keep These Secrets**
```bash
# Still needed for OIDC and deployments
AWS_ROLE_ARN          # ✅ The OIDC role you just added
AWS_REGION            # ✅ Still needed for AWS operations
S3_BUCKET             # ✅ Still needed for frontend deployment
STAGING_*             # ✅ All staging environment vars
# ... plus all your other non-AWS secrets
```

### **How to Remove Old Secrets**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click the **🗑️** next to `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
3. Or use GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh secret delete AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   gh secret delete AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   ```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **"Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"**
- ✅ Check that `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret is set in your **production environment**
- ✅ Verify OIDC provider exists in AWS IAM
- ✅ Confirm role trust policy allows your repository

### **"The security token is invalid"**
- ✅ Check `AWS_REGION` matches your AWS setup
- ✅ Verify OIDC provider URL is exactly: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`

### **ECR/ECS permission errors**
- ✅ Role needs permissions for ECR (push/pull) and ECS (update-service)
- ✅ Role needs `iam:PassRole` for ECS task execution

## 🎯 What's Next

After this PR is merged and tested:

1. **✅ OIDC Working**: Smoke test passes
2. **✅ Deployments Working**: Real deployments succeed
3. **🧹 Cleanup Secrets**: Remove old AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
4. **🔒 Tighten Permissions**: Consider least-privilege IAM policy if using broad permissions

**🎉 Congratulations!** You've successfully migrated to keyless AWS deployments with enhanced security!
