# Infrastructure & Deployment Audit - Phase 4: Orchestration

## Executive Summary
**Audit Phase**: Container Orchestration & Runtime Environment
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Focus**: Health monitoring, deployment strategies, and safety policies for our newly hardened container infrastructure

---

## 4.1 Health & Probes Assessment

### Current Health Check Implementation

#### Container-Level Health Checks
✅ **Implemented across all hardened Dockerfiles**:
- Frontend: Health validation for React application
- Backend Lambda: Import validation for Lambda functions
- Auth/Profile/Notification functions: Module loading checks
- Infrastructure: Basic readiness validation

#### Health Check Configuration
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3
```

#### AWS ECS Health Checks
✅ **Load Balancer Health Checks Configured**:
```terraform
health_check {
  enabled             = true
  interval            = 30
  path                = "/health"
  healthy_threshold   = 2
  unhealthy_threshold = 5
  timeout             = 5
  matcher             = "200-399"
}
```

**Analysis**: Good foundation with ALB health checks, but missing comprehensive application-level health endpoints.

### Required Orchestration Probes

#### Liveness Probes
**Purpose**: Detect when containers need to be restarted
**Current Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - ALB health checks exist but no deep health validation

#### Readiness Probes
**Purpose**: Determine when containers are ready to receive traffic
**Current Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Basic ALB readiness but no dependency checks

#### Startup Probes
**Purpose**: Handle slow-starting containers
**Current Status**: ❌ MISSING - Critical for Lambda cold starts

### Discovered Infrastructure

#### ECS Fargate Configuration
✅ **Container orchestration via AWS ECS**:
- Cluster: `${local.name_prefix}-cluster`
- Task Definition: CPU 256, Memory 512MB
- Launch Type: Fargate (serverless containers)
- Network Mode: awsvpc

#### Application Load Balancer
✅ **Traffic management configured**:
- HTTPS with TLS 1.3/1.2 policy
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- SSL termination with ACM certificates

### Recommendations
1. ✅ ALB health checks implemented
2. ❌ Add comprehensive `/health` endpoint in backend
3. ❌ Implement database connectivity validation
4. ❌ Add dependency readiness checks
5. ❌ Configure startup probes for Lambda cold starts

## 4.2 Deployment Strategy Assessment

### Current Deployment Architecture

#### Infrastructure Components
- **Frontend**: React SPA with Vite build system → ECS Fargate
- **Backend**: Flask API → ECS Fargate containers
- **Lambda Functions**: Auth, Profile, Notification services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with RLS (Row Level Security)
- **Container Registry**: Public ECR for Lambda containers
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with HTTPS/TLS 1.3

#### ECS Deployment Configuration
✅ **Current ECS Service Configuration**:
```terraform
deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 50
deployment_maximum_percent         = 200
desired_count                     = var.desired_count
launch_type                       = "FARGATE"
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Rolling deployment strategy implemented
- ✅ 50% minimum healthy ensures availability
- ✅ 200% maximum allows for blue/green transitions
- ❌ No automated rollback mechanism
- ❌ No deployment monitoring

#### Discovered Deployment Method
**Current Approach**: ECS Rolling Deployment with Terraform
**Risk Level**: ⚠️ MEDIUM - Basic rolling deployment without advanced safety nets

### Deployment Strategy Options Analysis

#### 1. Current: Rolling Deployment ✅
**Benefits**:
- ✅ Already implemented in ECS
- ✅ Resource efficient (50% min healthy)
- ✅ Gradual service replacement

**Limitations**:
- ❌ No immediate rollback capability
- ❌ Mixed version traffic during deployment
- ❌ No deployment validation gates

#### 2. Blue/Green Deployment (Recommended)
**Benefits**:
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Instant rollback capability
- Full environment validation
- AWS CodeDeploy ECS integration available

**Requirements for Implementation**:
- ECS service with CodeDeploy integration
- Duplicate target groups for ALB
- Automated testing pipeline
- Traffic shifting automation

#### 3. Canary Deployment
**Benefits**:
- Gradual traffic shifting (5% → 50% → 100%)
- Real-time monitoring validation
- Risk mitigation for critical changes

**Requirements**:
- ALB weighted routing rules
- CloudWatch metrics integration
- Automated rollback triggers

### Current Deployment Safety Mechanisms

#### Monitoring & Alerting
✅ **CloudWatch Integration**:
- Lambda function monitoring (errors, duration, throttles)
- SMS delivery metrics via SNS
- DynamoDB notification tracking
- Error log aggregation

#### Load Balancer Health Checks
✅ **ALB Health Validation**:
- 30-second interval health checks
- 5-second timeout
- Path: `/health` endpoint
- Automatic unhealthy instance removal

### Deployment Risks Identified

#### High Risk Areas
1. ❌ **No Rollback Strategy**: No automated rollback on deployment failures
2. ❌ **No Deployment Gates**: No validation before traffic shifting
3. ❌ **Database Migration Risk**: No coordinated DB schema deployment
4. ❌ **Lambda Version Management**: No automated Lambda alias management

### Current State Assessment
- ✅ Basic rolling deployment implemented via ECS
- ✅ Health checks prevent traffic to unhealthy containers
- ✅ Infrastructure monitoring in place
- ❌ No deployment strategy documentation
- ❌ No rollback procedures defined
- ❌ No deployment automation beyond Terraform
- ❌ No deployment validation gates

## 4.3 Policy & Safety Nets Assessment

### AWS ECS Safety Mechanisms (Current)

#### Service-Level Protections
✅ **ECS Service Configuration**:
```terraform
deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 50
deployment_maximum_percent         = 200
desired_count                     = var.desired_count
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ 50% minimum ensures availability during deployments
- ✅ 200% maximum allows for zero-downtime updates
- ⚠️ No connection draining configuration
- ❌ No explicit disruption budgets

#### Load Balancer Safety Nets
✅ **ALB Target Group Health Checks**:
- Automatic unhealthy target removal
- Health check path: `/health`
- 2 healthy/5 unhealthy threshold
- Traffic isolation for failed instances

### Resource Limits & Quotas

#### ECS Task Resource Allocation
✅ **Defined Resource Limits**:
```terraform
cpu    = "256"  # 0.25 vCPU
memory = "512"  # 512 MB
```

#### Lambda Function Limits
⚠️ **Need Verification**: Lambda resource configuration not visible in current Terraform

**Required Lambda Configurations**:
- Memory allocation (128-10,240 MB)
- Timeout limits (1-900 seconds)
- Concurrent execution limits
- Reserved concurrency settings

### Network Security Policies

#### Security Groups Analysis
✅ **Load Balancer Security Groups**: Configured for ALB traffic
✅ **Service Security Groups**: Configured for ECS service communication

**Current Security Group Rules** (require detailed audit):
- ALB → Internet (ports 80/443)
- ALB → ECS Service (application port)
- ECS Service → Database (PostgreSQL port)

#### Network Segmentation
⚠️ **Limited Visibility**: Need to audit VPC/subnet configuration

**Expected Network Policies**:
- Frontend containers → Backend API only
- Backend containers → Database only
- Deny all other inter-service communication
- Egress controls for external APIs

### High Availability & Resilience

#### Multi-AZ Deployment
✅ **ECS Service Deployment**:
```terraform
network_configuration {
  assign_public_ip = true
  subnets          = data.aws_subnets.default_public.ids
  security_groups  = [aws_security_group.service.id]
}
```

**Analysis**: Uses default public subnets (likely multi-AZ)

#### Auto Scaling Configuration
❌ **Missing**: No ECS service auto-scaling configured
❌ **Missing**: No CloudWatch-based scaling policies
❌ **Missing**: No target tracking scaling

### Security Context & Policies

#### Container Security Policies
✅ **Implemented in Dockerfiles**:
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only file systems (where applicable)
- Minimal attack surface via multi-stage builds

#### Service Mesh Security
❌ **Not Implemented**: No service mesh (Istio/Linkerd/App Mesh)

**Missing Security Features**:
- mTLS between services
- Traffic encryption in transit
- Identity-based access control
- Circuit breaker patterns

### Database Security & Access

#### Connection Security
✅ **Assumed**: PostgreSQL with RLS (Row Level Security)
⚠️ **Need Verification**: Database connection pooling
⚠️ **Need Verification**: Database access controls

### Disaster Recovery & Backup

#### Infrastructure State Management
✅ **Terraform State Backend**:
```terraform
backend "s3" {
  bucket         = "edgar-terraform-state-xyz"
  key            = "global/sprint1/terraform.tfstate"
  region         = "us-west-2"
  dynamodb_table = "TerraformLock"
  encrypt        = true
}
```

#### Backup Strategies
❌ **Missing**: No automated database backup strategy visible
❌ **Missing**: No infrastructure backup/recovery procedures
❌ **Missing**: No disaster recovery testing
