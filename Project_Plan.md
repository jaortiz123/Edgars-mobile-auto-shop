## 11. Portfolio Strategy for AWS SA Career üéØ

### **Demonstrating Breadth Without Overengineering**

#### **What Hiring Managers Actually Look For:**
1. **Business Acumen**: Choosing the right solution for the use case
2. **Cost Optimization**: Showing you understand AWS bills
3. **Architectural Thinking**: Planning for scale, not building for it prematurely
4. **Documentation**: Clear ADRs and decision matrices

#### **How This Project Shows SA Skills:**

| Skill Area | How You Demonstrate It | Interview Talking Point |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Cost Optimization | Serverless saves Edgar $800/year | "Reduced operational costs by 70%" |
| Scalability Planning | Container migration path documented | "Designed for 100x growth" |
| Security | Cognito + API Gateway + IAM roles | "Zero-trust architecture" |
| Operational Excellence | CloudWatch + X-Ray from day one | "Built-in observability" |
| Well-Architected Framework | Document review against all 6 pillars | "AWS best practices applied" |

#### **Container Knowledge Without Container Costs:**
1. **Dockerfile in repo**: "Ready for containerization when needed" ‚úÖ
2. **docker-compose.yml**: "Local development uses containers" ‚úÖ
3. **ECS Task Definitions**: "Prepared for migration at 10K appointments/month"
4. **Architecture diagrams**: Show both serverless and container versions

#### **Additional Portfolio Pieces from This Project:**
- Blog: "Serverless vs Containers: A Real-World Decision"
- Video: "Building a Business on AWS for Under $50/month"
- GitHub: Clean code with excellent documentation ‚úÖ
- Case Study: Before/after of Edgar's business operations

## 1. Architecture Conflicts üö®

### **CRITICAL CONFLICT: Serverless vs Containerized**
- **Sprint Plan**: Uses Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB (serverless) ‚úÖ
- **Kickoff Prompt**: Uses Docker + Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL + ECS (containerized) ‚úÖ
- **Impact**: Completely different skill sets, costs, and implementation approaches
- **Resolution**: Choose ONE approach or explicitly plan a hybrid architecture ‚úÖ

### **Proposed Resolution**
```
Days 1-2: Architecture Decision
- Document serverless-first approach with clear rationale ‚úÖ
- Core API: Lambda + API Gateway (cost-optimized for small business) ‚úÖ
- Event handlers: Lambda (notifications, integrations)
- Database: RDS PostgreSQL (relational data, smallest instance)
- Future scaling: Document container migration path ‚úÖ
- Portfolio artifact: Architecture Decision Record (ADR) showing analysis ‚úÖ
```

## 10. Contingency Plans üîÑ

1. Drop AI chatbot entirely
2. Simplify to email-only notifications
3. Use basic auth instead of Cognito
4. Deploy to single environment only
5. Defer admin dashboard

### **If Over Budget:**
1. Use single AZ deployments
2. Leverage free tiers aggressively
3. Use Lambda for everything
4. Defer monitoring tools
5. Manual processes for admin

## 12. Interview Preparation & Container Knowledge üíº

### **The Architecture Decision Story**

**When they ask: "Tell me about a time you made an architecture decision"**

> "I evaluated both serverless and containerized architectures for a mobile mechanic platform. I created a decision matrix comparing:
> - Initial costs: $35/month (serverless) vs $150/month (containers)
> - Time to market: 2 weeks vs 4 weeks  
> - Operational overhead: near-zero vs significant
> - Scale points: Clear migration trigger at 10K appointments/month
>
> I chose serverless but designed the API to be container-ready, documenting the migration path. This saved the business $800/year while maintaining future flexibility."

### **Proving Container Knowledge Without Using Containers**

#### **Week 1 Additions (30 min each):**
```yaml
Day 2: 
  - Create docker-compose.yml for local PostgreSQL ‚úÖ
  - Document why you're NOT using ECS (yet) ‚úÖ
  
Day 4:
  - Write Dockerfile for the API (but deploy as Lambda) ‚úÖ
  - Note: "Container-ready but serverless-deployed" ‚úÖ
  
Day 6:
  - Add container build to CI/CD pipeline ‚úÖ
  - Push to ECR (even though not deployed)
```

#### **Week 2 Additions:**
```yaml
Day 8:
  - Create ECS task definitions (uncommitted)
  - Document container migration triggers
  
Day 10:
  - Create architecture diagram showing container version
  - Write migration runbook
```

### **Three Documents That Prove You Understand Both:**

1. **Architecture Decision Record (ADR-001)**
   ```markdown
   # Serverless vs Container Decision
   
   ## Context
   Mobile mechanic with 10-20 daily appointments...
   
   ## Decision Matrix
   | Factor | Serverless | Containers | Winner |
   |--------|------------|------------|---------|
   | Monthly Cost | $35 | $150 | Serverless |
   | Time to Deploy | 1 week | 3 weeks | Serverless |
   | Scaling Effort | Automatic | Manual | Serverless |
   
   ## Migration Triggers
   - 10,000+ monthly appointments
   - Need for WebSocket connections
   - Complex ML model integration
   ```

2. **Migration Plan Document**
   - Step-by-step container migration
   - Cost projections at different scales
   - Zero-downtime migration strategy

3. **Blog Post**
   - "Why I Chose Serverless (And When I Wouldn't)"
