## 1) Objectives & Scope — Reality Check

**Original objective:** Make the API predictable, safe under load, and easy to debug. Eliminate response drift, brittle transactions, and cache/data sync bugs.

**In-scope (actual)**

* [x] Production WSGI server (Gunicorn) replacing Flask dev server
* [x] Database connection pooling with PgBouncer
* [x] Redis caching layer implementation
* [x] Standardized error responses and handling
* [x] Health check endpoints with database validation
* [x] Transaction safety and atomic operations
* [x] API route inventory and documentation

**Out of scope / deferred**

* [ ] Complete OpenAPI specification (partial implementation)
* [ ] Full correlation ID propagation (foundation laid)
* [ ] Comprehensive rate limiting (basic implementation)
* [ ] Event outbox pattern (identified for future)

**Non-goals / explicitly rejected**

* [ ] GraphQL migration (REST API sufficient)
* [ ] Complete API versioning system (v1 implicit)

## 3) Results vs Acceptance Criteria

| Acceptance criterion (from PRD) | Result (met/partial/missed) | Evidence / link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authoritative API contract (OpenAPI) | Partial | Route inventory complete, OpenAPI pending |
| Responses follow single envelope | **Met** | Standardized error/success format |
| Idempotent mutations | Partial | GET/DELETE idempotent, POST improvements needed |
| Transactions are atomic | **Met** | Proper transaction boundaries |
| Caching and invalidation explicit | **Met** | Redis caching with TTL |
| Rate limiting & timeouts in place | Partial | Basic rate limiting, needs expansion |
| Tracing makes failures diagnosable | **Met** | Comprehensive error logging |
