## 1) Objectives & Scope — Reality Check

**Original objective:** Ship a UI that never leaves the user stuck. Every critical flow has clear loading, empty, success, error, permission-denied, and offline states. Accessibility meets WCAG 2.2 AA. Performance meets Core Web Vitals.

**In-scope (actual)**

* [x] State Matrix implementation for all critical screens
* [x] Loading/Empty/Error/Success states across all components
* [x] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2 AA)
* [x] Responsive design 320px → 1920px+
* [x] Performance optimization and bundle reduction
* [x] Form validation with client/server parity
* [x] Error boundaries and fallback UI

**Out of scope / deferred**

* [ ] Full i18n implementation (English only for MVP)
* [ ] Dark mode theming (deferred to next phase)
* [ ] Offline-first PWA capabilities (partial implementation)

**Non-goals / explicitly rejected**

* [ ] Complete design system overhaul (incremental improvements chosen)
