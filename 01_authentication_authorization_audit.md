# Authentication & Authorization Security Audit

Date Completed: 2025-09-07
Scope: Backend Flask application, auth/session flows, multi-tenant boundaries, and supporting utilities.

## 5. Findings Register (Major Remediations)

- Unguarded admin routes
  - Status: Fixed. All admin endpoints except POST /api/admin/login are role-guarded via require_auth_role().
  - Evidence: Auth harness tests and route guard scan; PR #52 references.

- Dependency vulnerabilities (pip/npm)
  - Status: Fixed/pinned. Upgraded urllib3>=2.5.0 and addressed criticals highlighted by Safety/pip-audit; npm audit remediations applied previously.
  - Evidence: Triage artifacts in audit_artifacts/triage_summary.md; pins in requirements.

- Insecure cookies (Secure flag not enforced in prod)
  - Status: Fixed. Cookies now set HttpOnly + Secure in production; env-gated with FORCE_SECURE_COOKIES override.
  - Evidence: backend/local_server.py and backend/app/security/tokens.py changes in PR #52.

- Missing password strength policy and reset flow
  - Status: Fixed. Registration enforces validate_password_strength() with safe fallback; new password reset endpoints (request/reset) with hashed tokens and rate limits.
  - Evidence: backend/local_server.py routes; backend/app/security/reset_tokens.py; unit test backend/tests/test_password_policy.py.

- Cross-tenant access risks
  - Status: Addressed and monitored. RLS enforced via GUC app.tenant_id; guard tests in place.
  - Evidence: ENVIRONMENT_FIX_FOR_RLS.md; monitor-rls-drift.sql; manual audit notes.

## 13. Findings Summary

- Critical: 0 open / All identified remediated
- High: 0 open / All identified remediated
- Medium: Remaining items are documented as low-risk (contextual) — see triage_summary.md (e.g., Bandit B608 generators, B102 in vendored code)
- Low: Tracked with optional hardening (temp dirs, explicit timeouts) — deferred as non-blocking

## 14. Sign-off

- Auditor: Copilot, AI Security Analyst
- Backend Lead: Gemini, Senior Technical Lead

This document finalizes and formally closes the Authentication & Authorization security audit for Edgar's Mobile Auto Shop. All critical and high-priority issues have been remediated, and residual medium/low findings are documented with rationale and mitigations.
